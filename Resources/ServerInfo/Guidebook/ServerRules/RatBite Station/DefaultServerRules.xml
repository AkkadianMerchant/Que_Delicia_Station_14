# RatBite Server Rules

  This server is designed to let you be and do whoever and whatever you want! Follow this basic set of rules and whether or not you're a 'normal' player everyone should be able to have fun!

## SERVER RULES

  - 1. Abandon your preconceptions from other servers. You are free to do whatever here, but with ingame consequences. 
The only exceptions being the rest of these adminnable rules.
You will look silly if you complain about assistant rdm
  - 2. No exposing relevant game info you should not know via metacommunications.
You may play with friends and share basic information in close proximity, RP it as just being really in tune with your buddy, but DO NOT speak from the dead or give vital info over vast distances without a radio. Warning/ban.
  - 3. We have a mild NLR. Do not ruin the game by grudging or reporting from beyond the grave. You are also not to actively abuse ghost to gain information you should not have. (Even though shooting yourself to gain info with a med on standby is funny and based)
Warning/ban
  - 4. You must follow borg laws, mind control, and similar effects that dictate your behavior. Otherwise you will be dismissed as defective, your maker recompensated.  Warning/ban.
  - 5. As command, CC, and security roles (that start with mindshields), you must generally act in accordance with the station's interest. You cannot do mass station grief or kill people for no reason for example. You are  allowed to act outside the law, be abusive, do dictatorships, whatever, and your punishments will be in character. (from centcomm if your actions are reported/seen)
Warning/roleban.
  - 6. If you choose to play a centcomm role, you ABSOLUTELY MUST follow your SoP. (once written and implemented) CC roles will receive CC communications regarding problem players and minor rules enforcement. They represent the rules and enforcement of said rules. Play them if you wish to narc on bad people, not for the power.
Roleban.
  - 7. You are to not evade the slur filter, you are not to say slurs ooc, and you are not to abusively/obnoxiously harass people with extreme real life grievances. You are fully allowed to engage in any degree of ingame specism, make mild off color jokes about even real life categories of people, and even say slurs. But bringing your genuine biases into the game or saying extreme real life slurs with malicious or obnoxious results will get you banned.
Warning/ban.
  - 8. No ERP, also no dating in character unless you know the person. We don't encourage accidentally RPing romance with minors.
